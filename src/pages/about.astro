    <p> Hi, nice to have you here!🧡💙</p>
    <br>

    <p>
        I'm Mark (Yixuan Xie) -- 
        I am a coming junior student majoring in Comp Science and Statistics at the <strong>University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)</strong>. 
        I am a CS enthusiast who loves seeking creative solutions to complex challenges! Feel free to connect with me, ask questions, or simply start a conversation about the latest tech trends, 
        coding challenges, or any other topic that sparks your interest.

        The word <strong>"孤独の柒"</strong> means A Lonly Seven. 
         
        It's a blend of the evocative phrase <q>Either lonly or vulgar</q>, and my cherished number <strong>"7"</strong>. 
        Though, at the time I coined this name, I had not yet delved into the works of Schopenhauer.
        My affection for the number 7 was inspired by the poem, “The Square Root of Three.”
